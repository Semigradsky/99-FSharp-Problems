Ninety-Nine F# Problems
These are F# solutions of Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems 
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), 
which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems
(http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
and Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems
(https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).

If you would like to contribute a solution or fix any bugs, send 
an email to paks at kitiara dot org with the subject "99 F# problems". 
I'll try to update the problem as soon as possible.

The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) 
are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to 
solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of 
intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled F# programmer it shouldn't take you more than 
30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution

Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with 
letters. There are actually only 88 problems.
